# GretaVanFleet-Project
Welcome to my project, were I seek to answer the question: "Do bands, such as Greta Van Fleet, typically perform in places where they have the most listeners?"

My question was sparked intially by the artist's page on spotify. I thought the listed top listener locations were interesting, so I googled the most recent touring locations and discovered some inconsistencies. Diving deeper, I collected data from SongStats and Concerful to discover if Greta Van Fleet was taking advantage of their current listener locations during their tours. 

In this repo you will find:
 - code from cleaning my web-scraped data (using dataminer)
 - a link to my dashboard in tableau public, where you will find the finished presentation
